    #
    # Your input dataframe should have columns for timestamp, close price, volume, and any other indicators you've calculated (like RSI, MACD, etc.).
    #
    #
    # Lookback Period:
    #
    # The lookback parameter (set to 60 in the example) determines how many 1-minute intervals the model will see.
    # 60 minutes gives the model an hour of context to make its 5-minute prediction.
    #
    #
    # Features:
    #
    # Adjust the features list to include all relevant columns from your dataframe.
    # Consider including derived features like price changes, moving averages, or custom indicators.

    # Target Variable:
    #
    # The function creates a binary target: 1 if the price is higher after 5 minutes, 0 if lower or the same.

    #
    # The function uses MinMaxScaler to normalize the features. This is crucial for the LSTM model to perform well.

    # This architecture is designed for binary classification (price up or down) using time series data. Here's a breakdown of the model:
    #
    # Input: The model expects input data shaped as (lookback_window, num_indicators), where lookback_window is the number of time steps to consider, and num_indicators is the number of technical indicators you're using.
    # LSTM Layers: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers are used to capture temporal dependencies in the data. We use two LSTM layers, allowing the model to learn both short-term and long-term patterns.
    # BatchNormalization: These layers normalize the activations of the previous layer, which can speed up training and reduce the sensitivity to network initialization.
    # Dropout: Helps prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 during training.
    # Dense Layers: The final dense layers interpret the features extracted by the LSTM layers and make the final prediction.
    # Output: A single neuron with sigmoid activation for binary classification (up or down).
    #
    # Regarding transfer learning:
    # Transfer learning is less common in time series prediction tasks, especially for cryptocurrency price prediction, due to the unique and rapidly changing nature of crypto markets. However, you could consider the following approaches:
    #
    # Pre-training on related assets: Train your model on data from multiple cryptocurrencies or on longer historical data of the same asset, then fine-tune on your specific asset and time frame.
    # Feature extraction: Use pre-trained models for feature extraction from raw price data, then use these features as input to your prediction model.
    # Multi-task learning: Train your model to predict multiple related tasks (e.g., price movement for different time horizons) and then fine-tune for your specific 5-minute prediction task.
    #
    # To use this model effectively:
    #
    # Data Preparation:
    #
    # Ensure your input data is properly normalized (e.g., using MinMaxScaler).
    # Create sequences of data with the appropriate lookback window.
    # Split your data into training, validation, and test sets, being careful not to introduce future information bias.
    #
    #
    # Feature Engineering:
    #
    # Select relevant technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD).
    # Consider including market sentiment indicators or on-chain metrics if available.
    #
    #
    # Model Training:
    #
    # Use techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling to improve training.
    # Monitor for overfitting using the validation set.
    #
    #
    # Evaluation:
    #
    # Use appropriate metrics beyond accuracy, such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
    # Consider the model's performance in terms of potential trading strategy profitability.
    #
    #
    #
    # Remember that predicting short-term price movements in cryptocurrency markets is extremely challenging due to their volatile nature. It's crucial to rigorously validate your model and consider incorporating risk management strategies in any practical application.


    # Using 1-minute quotes as training data for a 5-minute prediction model is a good approach. It provides a granular view of price movements that can capture important short-term patterns. Here's why this could be beneficial and how to approach it:
    #
    # Data Granularity:
    #
    # 1-minute data provides more detailed information about price movements within the 5-minute prediction window.
    # It allows the model to potentially identify micro-trends or patterns that might be missed with lower frequency data.
    #
    #
    # Feature Engineering:
    #
    # With 1-minute data, you can create more nuanced features that capture intra-5-minute behavior.
    # For example, you could calculate volatility measures or momentum indicators over the past 1, 3, and 5 minutes.
    #
    #
    # Sequence Length:
    #
    # If predicting 5 minutes ahead, you might want to use a sequence of 30-60 minutes of 1-minute data as input.
    # This would give the model context from recent price action to make its prediction.

    # Considerations when using 1-minute data:
    #
    # Data Quality: Ensure your 1-minute data is accurate and accounts for any exchange downtimes or data gaps.
    # Computational Resources: 1-minute data will be much larger than 5-minute data. Ensure you have sufficient computational resources.
    # Noise: 1-minute data can be noisier. Your model might need to be more complex to filter out this noise effectively.
    # Overfitting Risk: With more granular data, there's a higher risk of the model overfitting to noise. Use regularization techniques and carefully monitor validation performance.
    # Feature Engineering: With 1-minute data, you can create features that capture very short-term price dynamics. Experiment with different feature combinations.
